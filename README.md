What this project does is use the file 'Spotify.txt' where we save our set of emails and passwords, running the "chromedriver.exe" as a browser in window mode.

What the bot does is connect to the platform and verify if the credentials we provide are correct.

And it stores the bad credentials in a file called "BAD.txt", and the correct credentials in a file
called "DONE.txt".

This bot is made for educational purposes and is an updated version of a project already published on Github.

To start the Checker we need to run the "start.bat" which is customized to automatically run the checker in python.

If this file does not work, it is recommended to modify the "start.bat" with a text editor and add the path where the "Spotify-checker-bs4-selenium.py" file is located.
